# Recipies App

Welcome to my Recipies app! This is a basic app written in React Native and created as an Expo App. The app is designed to present a new recipe to the user every time they refresh the page.

## Functionality
The app fetches an image from an online URL and loads the text information from a database. Please note that the database used for this app may not be entirely stable, so there may be occasional issues with data loading.

## Getting Started
To use this app, simply download the code and run it using the Expo App. Once you have the app up and running, simply refresh the page to see a new recipe.
In any case I am also attaching zipped project into repozitory.
